      <h1>Exoplanet</h1>
      <p>Any planet outside of our solar system is an exoplanet. The majority of exoplanets orbit other stars, while rogue planets—free-floating exoplanets that are unattached to any star—orbit the galactic centre.</p>

      <h3>Types of exoplanets</h3>
      <p> <b><u>Gas giants</u></b> are planets the size of Saturn or Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, or much, much larger. These were among the first planet types found – gas giants orbiting so close to their stars that their temperatures soar into the thousands of degrees.</p>

      <p><b><u>Neptunian planets</u></b>  are similar in size to Neptune or Uranus in our solar system. They likely have a mixture of interior compositions, but all will have hydrogen and helium-dominated outer atmospheres and rocky cores. </p>

      <p><b><u>Super-Earths</u></b>  are typically terrestrial planets that may or may not have atmospheres. They are more massive than Earth but lighter than Neptune.</p>

      <p><b><u>Terrestrial planets</u></b> are Earth-sized and smaller, composed of rock, silicate, water or carbon. Further investigation will determine whether some of them possess atmospheres, oceans or other signs of habitability.</p>
