        <h1>Volcano</h1>
        <p>A volcano is a crack in the crust of the planet. Hot gases and melted rock from deep under the Earth's crust rise to the surface when a volcano erupts. This substance may gently leak out of a ground fracture or it may explode violently into the air. Volcanic eruptions might cause a lot of damage. However, they also produce fresh terrain. Today, there are more than 1,500 volcanoes that could be active.</p>
